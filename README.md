# observedtest
## Goal
The goal with this project was to become more comfortable with passing data among views, view models and models. I welcome feedback in regards to those topics in addition to any other coding principles. 

## Issues
- The data in the scoreboard is simply hard coded data. I plan to continue to build out this application in some shape, manner or form into a "game". 
- I am unable to figure out, at this time how to get the scoreboard items lined up in the proper grid format.
